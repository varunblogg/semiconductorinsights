IC and LED Lead Frames Market Overview

Lead Frame is the basic component that delivers electric signal to external circuits and supports the chip inside of semiconductor package mechanically. A lead frame consists of a die mounting paddle and lead fingers. The die paddle serves primarily to mechanically support the die during package manufacture. The lead fingers connect the die to the circuitry external to the package.
Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd. (SMM) has withdrawn from the lead frame business, based on an assessment of the changing business environment. The lead frame market itself has gone from a growth market to the mature phase, resulting in over-commoditization of lead frame products. Moreover, the emergence of Chinese local manufacturers has intensified competition for these products. On March 17, 2017, Chang Wah Technology purchased SH Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., a Singapore-based investment company, from SH Materials Co., Ltd. (SHM). In 2017, Jin Lin Technology has merger and acquisition three power device lead manufacturer from Japan Sumitomo Metals (SMM), which are SH Precision Co., Ltd (Japan), Suzhou SH Precision Co., Ltd (China) and Malaysian SH Precision Sdn Bhd (Malaysia). Nowadays, Jih Lin Technology is status as the top power devices lead frame manufacturer of the world. On 28 July 2020, ASM Pacific Technology, together with Wise Road Capital LTD and Asia-IO Capital Management Limited, announced the formation of a Strategic Joint Venture (SJV) for ASM Pacific Technologys Materials Segment Business Unit, which produces lead frames.
