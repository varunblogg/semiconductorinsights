Carbon Resistor Market Overview
A carbon resistor, also known as a carbon composition resistor, is a passive electronic component used to regulate electric current in circuits. It consists of a resistive element made from a carbon particle and binder mixture, housed within a cylindrical or rectangular body. These resistors are widely used due to their cost-effectiveness, reliability, and ability to handle high-energy pulses. The two major types include carbon-composition resistors and carbon-film resistors.
