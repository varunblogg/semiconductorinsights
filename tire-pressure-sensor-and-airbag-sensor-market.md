## Tire Pressure Sensor and Airbag Market Overview
Tire Pressure Sensors (TPS) monitor the air pressure within a vehicleâ€™s tires, ensuring they are within the optimal range for safety and performance. If the pressure deviates from the set parameters, the sensor alerts the driver. Airbag Sensors detect the severity of a collision and trigger the deployment of airbags to protect occupants during an accident. These sensors are critical components in vehicle safety systems, helping prevent accidents and reduce injuries in the event of a crash.
