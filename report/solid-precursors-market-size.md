Solid Precursors Market Overview
This report studies the solid precursors are used in semiconductor applications and excel in Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), especially for metals deposition. Solid precursors based on hafnium and zirconium have been used in semiconductor fabs for decades. New solid precursors based on aluminum (Al), molybdenum (Mo), and tungsten (W) are needed to meet the device and integration requirements for the latest generation of 3D devices. As layers become thinner, materials requirements often change. The drive toward fluorine-free materials mitigates yield loss that can occur when fluorine reacts with nanoscale layers in devices. In the case of W precursors, tungsten pentachloride (WCl5) is replacing gaseous tungsten hexafluoride (WF6). WCl5 is a solid at room temperature.
