Absolute Angle Encoder Market Overview
An absolute angle encoder is a type of rotary encoder that measures the absolute position or angle of a rotating object. Unlike incremental encoders, which measure relative changes in position, absolute angle encoders provide a direct measurement of the absolute angle without the need for a reference point or reset. This allows for more accurate and precise angle measurements, making them ideal for applications where maintaining position accuracy is critical.

These encoders typically consist of a rotating disc or shaft with evenly spaced marks or codes and a sensor that reads these marks to determine the absolute position. The sensor technology can be optical, magnetic, or capacitive, depending on the design. The digital output of absolute angle encoders is often in formats such as binary, Gray code, or BCD (binary-coded decimal), with resolution depending on the number of unique positions the encoder can detect.
