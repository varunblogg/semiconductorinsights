Force Sensitive Resistors (FSRs) Market Overview

Force Sensitive Resistors (FSRs) use two sets of electrically distinct interdigitated fingers printed on a conductor substrate. A thin spacer separates the circuit from a layer of conductive ink. When a force or pressure, whether from a human touch or other source, is applied to the surface of the sensor, the conductive ink creates shunts between the two sets of fingers, completing the circuit and decreasing the device‚Äùs resistance, which can be measured. The resulting sensor is thin, flexible, and resilient. Plus, their low cost and easy integration make them a great choice for scalable projects.
Growing Demand in Consumer Electronics: The increasing integration of FSRs in consumer electronics, such as touchscreens, wearable devices, gaming controllers, and smartphones, drives the demand for these sensors.
Rising Adoption in Automotive Industry: FSRs are utilized in automotive applications for touch-sensitive controls, smart airbags, seat occupancy detection, and more, contributing to the growth of the market as the automotive industry continues to advance.
