# Semiconductor Gas Abatement Systems Market, Size, Trends, Business Strategies 2025-2032

## Semiconductor Gas Abatement Systems Market Overview
The semiconductor industry uses gases that are toxic, flammable and even harmful for the environment, but also for humans. For example, in the production of microchips. According to national legislation, these gases have to be abated. This means that they are reduced below the respective threshold limit value (TLV). Different gases require different treatment technologies, such as thermal, wet or even a combination of both technologies. The process exhaust gases can then be released into the atmosphere, without harming nature, for a greener world.

## Semiconductor Gas Abatement Systems Market Analysis:
The global Semiconductor Gas Abatement Systems market size was estimated at USD 1379 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 2704.43 million by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 10.10% during the forecast period.
