## Mini LED Laser Chip Repair Equipment Market Overview
In terms of technology, display and other advantages, Mini and Micro LED inherit the characteristics of LED. The energy consumption is only 10% of LCD and 50% of OLED. The brightness is 30 times that of OLED, and the resolution can reach 1500PPI. In addition, it also has the advantages of high reliability, fast speed, long life and fast response. In order to improve the yield rate of mass transfer and mass welding of Mini LED and Micro LED chips, repair is an indispensable key process step in the manufacturing process. Take mass transfer as an example. During the transfer process, the accuracy of each chip must be controlled within plus or minus 0.5 microns, otherwise it will cause a loss of yield. Take the manufacturing of 4K TVs as an example. Even if the yield rate reaches 99.999%, it will still There will be 260 bad pixels that need to be repaired. The high precision and high directivity of laser play a huge role here. Usually, the laser chip repair process includes steps such as AOI detection, laser removal and laser welding repair. First, high-precision detection equipment is used to identify and locate the chip’s dead pixels, and then a high-peak energy laser beam is used to remove the dead pixel chips. Afterwards, the single chip is processed through Transfer and laser welding repair to finally complete the repair of the bad pixels.
