## InP Lasers Market Overview
Indium Phosphide (InP) is used to produce efficient lasers, sensitive photodetectors and modulators in the wavelength window typically used for telecommunications, i.e., 1550 nm wavelengths, as it is a direct bandgap III-V compound semiconductor material. Indium phosphide (InP) is a binary semiconductor composed of indium and phosphorus. It has a face-centered cubic (“zincblende”) crystal structure, identical to that of GaAs and most of the III-V semiconductors. When design and fabrication is optimised InP lasers provide high spectral purity and optical power, over a wide temperature range.
