Advanced Interconnect Packaging Inspection and Metrology Systems Market Overview

Advanced Interconnect Packaging Inspection and Metrology System is combining wafer manufacturing and device encapsulation technologies. WLP is a chip-scale-packaging technology where many IC‚Äùs can be stacked together using suitable interconnect processes (like TSV or metal bumps) followed by encapsulation. Advanced Packaging Inspection Systems is designed to inspect advanced wafer-level packaging process steps, providing information on the full range of defect types for inline process control through multi-mode optics and sensors and advanced defect detection algorithms.

The global market for semiconductor was estimated at US$ 579 billion in the year 2022, is projected to US$ 790 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 6% during the forecast period. Although some major categories are still double-digit year-over-year growth in 2022, led by Analog with 20.76%, Sensor with 16.31%, and Logic with 14.46% growth, Memory declined with 12.64% year over year. The microprocessor (MPU) and microcontroller (MCU) segments will experience stagnant growth due to weak shipments and investment in notebooks, computers, and standard desktops. In the current market scenario, the growing popularity of IoT-based electronics is stimulating the need for powerful processors and controllers. Hybrid MPUs and MCUs provide real-time embedded processing and control for the topmost IoT-based applications, resulting in significant market growth. The Analog IC segment is expected to grow gradually, while demand from the networking and communications industries is limited. Few of the emerging trends in the growing demand for Analog integrated circuits include signal conversion, automotive-specific Analog applications, and power management. They drive the growing demand for discrete power devices.
