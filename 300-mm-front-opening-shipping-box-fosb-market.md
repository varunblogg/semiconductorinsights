300 mm Front Opening Shipping Box (FOSB) Market Overview:
A 300 mm Front Opening Shipping Box (FOSB) is a robust container designed for the transport and storage of silicon wafers during their journey across various manufacturing stages in the semiconductor industry. Much like Front Opening Unified Pods (FOUPs), FOSBs maintain the cleanliness and protection of wafers, ensuring their safe handling across supply chains. However, while FOUPs are mainly used in semiconductor fabrication facilities for wafer processing, FOSBs are primarily used for transportation and shipping between different facilities.

The FOSB’s design includes features that prevent contamination, preserve wafer integrity, and allow seamless integration with automated logistics systems. These containers play a key role in ensuring that wafers reach their destination undamaged and free from contaminants, which is crucial for maintaining the quality of semiconductor products.
